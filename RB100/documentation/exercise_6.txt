Symbols¶ ↑
A Symbol represents a name inside the ruby interpreter. See
Symbol for more details on what symbols are and when ruby
creates them internally.

You may reference a symbol using a colon: :my_symbol.

You may also create symbols by interpolation:

:"my_symbol1"
:"my_symbol#{1 + 1}"
Like strings, a single-quote may be used to disable interpolation:

:'my_symbol#{1 + 1}' #=> :"my_symbol\#{1 + 1}"
When creating a Hash, there is a special syntax for referencing a Symbol as well.
